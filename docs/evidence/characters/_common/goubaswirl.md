**Finding:**  
The Anemo application on ally gadgets from Faruzan's E and Sucrose's E are 2U.  

**Evidence:**

on Yuegui: Hilichurl 2U arrow applies 1.6U aura with 12s duration, after Guoba swirl it lasted for 4:47  
on Baron Bunny: after sitting in water for >1.5s, baron bunny has 2u hydro aura with 8s duration, after getting pushed out of water+guoba swirl it lasted for ~4s  
in both cases the aura GU was reduced by ~1U meaning the Guoba swirl Anemo gauge is ~2U

using 2U anemo to proc swirl on a ~1.6U aura results in a 3.45U swirl attack, which should result in a 15.625 duration aura.  
resulting aura in the clip lasted 15:43, in line with expectation  

**Significance:**  
Swirl gauge; understanding of spaghetti code?
